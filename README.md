## Project Planning & User Experience (UX)

With the principles of design, I have followed the five planes of strategy, Scope, Structure, and surface. My aim is to make my website responsive, clear, accessible, and eye-catching.

### Purpose of the Website

The purpose of the website is to showcase what the gaming group has been doing and what they have planned this will include a schedule and upcoming events. The website will also allow others to learn a little about the group and join a waiting list. There will also be a small section to book tickets to events.

### About the group

The group consists of six friends from in and around the local area of Neath Port Talbot. The group plays tabletop roleplaying games and met through a love of Dungeons and Dragons.

### User Goals

- To view who the group is
- To view information about what is on
- To check for updates including live streams
- To contact the group to join the waiting list or to ask a question.
- To book a place on to a session

### Group Goals

- To have an easy-to-follow schedule
- To have a professional-looking website
- To develop an online presence and give people a chance to see what's happening
- To gain potential players on a waiting list.

### First Time Visitor

- A first-time visitor will want to quickly find a way to contact the group, they can do this via the Contact Me page.
- They will likely want to see what games are being played or what the future schedules look like.
- They may use it to find social media pages
- They may use it to join the waiting list to join games.
- They may use it to find out who is in the group and if it's an inclusive space.
- They may use it to book a space for an event.

### Returning Visitors

- A returning visitor would likely want to view an ongoing schedule and future games.
- They may have forgotten contact information or social links so are coming back to get in touch or follow the group.
- They could also just be looking for updates on a waiting list and future events.
- They may want to join the waiting list
- Or book into a session

### Frequent Visitors

- Will likely be there to find out what is happening on the schedule.
- They will use the site to view updates and new events.
- They will also likely go to the waiting list to see if any spots have opened.

## The Five Planes

#### Strategy

Questions I have considered during my research include:
Who is likely to use this site: Target Audience? The target audience is people interested in learning or playing Table Top Role-playing games (TTRPG) in the local area.

Is the content relevant? I will need to make sure that the site looks professional for any interested party to view and use the site efficiently by having clear and informative pages.

Group Goals: The Group would love to become an official group and a safe and inclusive space for Neurodivergent adults, Minorities, and LGBTQIA+ people. They also hope to grow and apply for grants to grow in the future.

#### Scope

Needs: The website needs to have a contact information page that has a clear join the waiting list option. So that visitors can get in touch or request to join.
It should also have information about who we are, and what we do to make the group clear and accessible to people. It also needs to have an easy-to-view and read schedule, so visitors can see what is going on and when.

Must-Have Pages: Home, Schedule, and Contact.
If I have enough time I will also include a members page, as a social story to help others see how the group is!

Potential options for later: Blog, Streaming options, and application form for download.

#### Structure

The website needs to be a clear and simple structure, with easy-to-follow straightforward links. It needs to be consistent and meet conventions of structure to allow ease of use and user consistency.

#### Skeleton

Navigation: Visual iconography to help navigation. Simple Navigation bar

Interface: Needs to be visually appealing and clear. Meets the needs of users!

Features: The features I use must be useful, and follow the same pattern. Information needs to be put in priority order. With minimal features and complexity to add to usability and a better user experience.

#### Surface

The visual look of the website is very important. As many of the group is Neurodivergant I want to make sure the fonts, colors, images, and order of the website are as clean and appealing as possible. One issue ND people have is with certain fonts and colors, so I will use basic colors and fonts. With minimal blocks of text to make it easier to read.

### Structure

Every page will contain the d20 header image and an alert to an application form for new members (to be put on a waiting list). I will also have a footer and location map on each page. I will include four pages: Home, Members, Schedule, and Contact.

- Header
  For my header, I added a bootstrap navigation bar with a custom icon. I used font awesome to add the D20, a twenty-sided dice in one of my chosen colors. I then added a large hero image of another d20 with a set of dice in the background. I chose this image as it looked clean and fitted with the general aesthetic of the website. Underneath the hero image I added an alert, the alert gives users the option to sign up for the waiting list.
  I used Survey Monkey to create a basic application form. This would give people a chance to tell us about themselves and request to join.

- Home
  A simple home page, with a brief history and a nice image to greet the user.
  The home page needs to be clear, and concise with a need to know only information base.
  I also added a basic news article onto this page which will be about our upcoming live stream and a link to support the group. At the time of creating this webpage, the group wasn't ready for GoFundMe, so a link to GoFundMe was added instead.

- Members
  A basic section detailing the group members and a small sentence each with an image displayed for everyone. I added this as more of a social story, to allow potential Neurodivergent people the option of seeing who was in the group and following them to learn more. Only one of the members 'Clarice' had a public gaming page so I linked them all to Instagram until such times as they had ready social media platforms to follow.

- Schedule
  I have included a small table with a list of games we are currently playing and the levels. I also added some more information but added a further what's on section, giving the option to procure tickets to events. These were not quite ready to go so dummy links to ticketsource were added.

- Contact
  I have included a simple bootstrap form to help visitors get in contact with the group. I have added a form dump to Code Institute for my form for this project.

- Footer
  For my footer, I added the location map for quick ease in finding the group. I also added social media links these were all dummy links only going to the websites themselves. The group had yet to set up the social media sites but was looking at doing so in the near future.
  The social media links I used were:
  Facebook
  Twitter
  Twitch
  Instagram
  I also added a copyright section, with a link to the my GitHub account.

### Colour Palette

I used Bootstrap's built-in colors to bring my website to life. However, I did use some flashes of color throughout the site.

### Typography

As a woman with ASD, I wanted to make the website as accessible for others as possible. One thing I and other ND people can struggle with is typography and content. I will research what will work better for a more visually appealing and friendly website.

Another thing I noticed is that large walls of texts are incredibly off-putting and most people just don't bother to read them. So I tried to keep everything as basic and concise as I was able.

- Font type:
  Part of my research was to find out which fonts were best for accessibility and the following came up: Tahoma, Calibri, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana & Times New Roman.
  Slab Serif fonts including Arvo, Museo Slab, and Rockwell were accessible but for headings rather than body text.

### Imagery

I used some pictures the group had taken themselves for the member section. It was quickly apparent how much better professional images would look. But this wasn't possible for this project. I will try to make sure in the future, professional images are available. I also used some royalty-free images to bolster the pages and make everything pop out.

## Technologies used

### Languages

- Html 5
- CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programmes

- Bootstrap - At the time of writing this readme I was using the latest version of Bootstrap which was v5.3.
- Fontawesome.com: Was used for Icons across the site.
- Favicon.io: Allowed me to add a custom D20 Dice to the wesbite.

### Websites

- Coolers: I developed my color palette using coolers.
- Survey Monkey: I used Survey Monkey to set up an application form to join the waiting list.
- Tinypng.com: I used this to compress my image files down so they didnt slow down the pages.

### Future Ideas

The webpage could be used in the future to stream live games. A blog could also be added as well as writing content and tables for other tabletop players.
We could also have a more detailed calendar and schedule, with a more thorough booking system rather than TicketSource.

## Testing

#### Is my site Accessible?

### WC3

My results from WC3:

[Index Page Pass](assets/images/index-testing-pass.jpg)

Here is the tested page finished with direct code input, the only issue was Codeanywhere now using trailing slash that the validator picked up on but is now acceptable syntax.

[Members Page Pass](assets/images/members-pass.jpg)

Here is the finished page, done with direct input.

[Schedule Page Pass](assets/images/schedule-pass.jpg)

This is the pass page done via direct input

My CSS results: [CSS Pass](assets/images/css-pass.png)

### Peer Review

To be added...

### Bugs

##### Testing Bugs

[Home Page Errors](assets/images/index-errors.jpg).

Index Page Error report: The error report came back with two errors on my 'make-a-wish' image. I added the width and height as an inline styling. So needed to adjust and add it to the CSS instead.

[Members Page Errors](assets/images/members-errors.jpg)
I had three errors: One was a simple stray div which was removed. The other was my hr element which had inline styling I added the CSS. I also need to change a section element to a div in my social media links.

[Schedule Page Errors](assets/images/schedule-errors.jpg)
I only had one error on this page and it was a simple stray div tag end which was easily removed.

There were no errors on my contact page

##### Self-Found Bugs

- Bug 1: When I deployed my site, I found most of my images were not loading. I added the images as absolute file paths. But then changed them to relative file paths.
- Bug 2: My 'make-a-wish' image was not responsive on Galaxy fold screens. To rectify this I needed to remove the class paddings and my CSS sizing options which stopped it from working correctly.

- Bug 3: Favicon was not loading. The issue was the images were not linked correctly to the root directory.

- Bug 4: The Contact form not functioning properly. I needed to change my code and add the required to all the input options.

### Accessibility

I wanted to make sure there was a strong contrast between elements and background colors, so I utilized bootstrap to draw out boxes and information.
I added Alternative text to images to ensure that visually impaired users could understand what the image was.

Part of building this website was to factor in how to make the site more accessible to everyone. Big blocks of long text, different fonts, and off-putting colors can all have an impact on how easy the site is to navigate.

I got some Neurodivergant friends to review the site and they found that a few of the boxes were overwhelming with text. I then narrowed the content down much further and included just a few sentences on the member's page as they found it far more readable and enjoyable.

## Deployment
