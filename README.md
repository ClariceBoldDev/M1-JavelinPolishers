## Project Planning & User Experience (UX)

With the principles of design I have followed the five planes of stratergy, Scope, Structure & Surface. My aim is to make my website as responsive, clear, accessible and eye catching.

### Purpose of the Website

The purpose of the website is to showcase what the gaming goup have been doing and what they have planned this will include a shedule and upcoming events. The website will also allow others to learn a little about the group and join a waiting list.

### About the group

The group consist of seven friends from in and around the local area of Neath Port Talbot. The group play table top roleplaying games and met through a love of Dungeons and Dragons.

### User Goals

* To view who the group are
* To view a shedule
* To check for updates including live streams
* To contact the group to join the waiting list or to ask a question.

### Group Goals

* To have a easy to follow shedule
* To have a professional looking website
* To develop a online presence and build up a potential fan base
* To gain potential players on a waiting list.
  
### First Time Visitor

* A first time visitor will want to quickly find a way to contact the group, they can do htis via the contact me page.
* They will likely want to see what games are being played or what the future shedules look like.  
* They may use it to find socila media pages
* #The may use it to join the waiting list to join games.
* The may use it to find out who is in the group and if its an inclusive space.

### Returning Visitors

* A returning visitor would likely want to view an ongoing shedule and future games.
* They may have forgotten contact infomation or social links so are coming back to get in touch or follow the group.
* They could also just be looking for updates on waiting list and future events.

### Frequent Visitors

* Will likely be there to find out what is happening on the shedule.
* They will use the site to view updated and new or events.
* They will also likely go to the waiting list to see if any spots have opened.

## The Five Planes

#### Strategy

Questions I have condidered during my research include:
Who is likely to use this site: Target Audience? Target audience is people interested in learning or playing Table Top Role playing games (TTRPG) in the local area.

Is the content relevant? I will need to make sure that the site looks professional for any interested party to view and use the site effectiantly but by having clear and infomative pages.

Group Goals: The Group would love to become and offical group and a safe and inclusive space for Neurodivergant adults, Minorities and LGBTQIA+ people. They alos hope to grow and apply for grants to grow in the future.

#### Scope

Needs: The wesbite needs to have a contact infomation page that has a clear join the waiting list option.So that visitors can get in touch or request to join.
It should also have infomation about who we are, what we do to make the group clear and accessible to people. It also needs to have a easy to view and read shedule so visitors can see what is going on and when.

Must Have Pages: Home, Team, Shedule and Contact.

Potential options for later: Blog, Streaming options and application for download.

#### Structure

The website needs to be clear and simple structure, with easy to follow straightforward links. It needs to be consistant and meet conventions of structure to allow ease of use and user consistency.

#### Skeleton

Navigation: Visual iconography to help navigation. Simple Navigation bar

Interface: Needs to be visually appealing and clear. Meets the needs of users!

Features: The features I use must be useful, and follow the same pattern. Infomation needs to be put in priority order. With minimal features and complexity to add to usebility and a better user experience.

#### Surface

The visual look of the website is very important. As many of the group is Neurodivergant I want to make sure the fonts, colours, images and order of the website is as clean and appealing as possible. One issue ND people have is with certain fonts and colours, so I will research this and provide a better visual experience for them makign it more acccesible.

## Design Layout & Structure

### Wireframes

 (Wireframe will be added here)

### Structure

* Home
* Members
* Shedule
* Contact

### Colour Palette

 (Add a colour paltte image here)

### Typography

As a woman with ASD I wanted to make the website as accessible for others as possible. One thing myself and other ND people can struggle with is typography and content. I will research what will work better for a more visual appealing and friendly website.

* Font type:
Part of my research was to find out which fonts where best for accessability and the following came up: Tahoma, Calibri, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana & Times New Roman.
Slab Serif fonts including Arvo, Museo Slab and Rockwell were accessible but for headings rather than body text.

* Font Size
* Font spacing
  
### Imagery

I used some pictures the group had taken but also used some royality free images to bolster the pages and make everything pop out.

## Technologies used

### Languages

* Html 5
* CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programmes

* Bootstrap - At the time of writing this readme I was using the latest version of bootstrap which was v5.3.
* Favicon.io: A custom D20 (20 sided dice was added to my wesbite using Favicon.io)
* Fontawesome.com: Was used for Icons across the site.

### Websites

* <https://mdbootstrap.com/> -  For my footer.

### Future Ideas

## Testing

### WC3

### Peer Review

### Bugs

Is my site accessable (siteimprove.com):

### Accessability

Part of building this website was to factor in how to make the site more accessabile to everyone. Big blocks of long text, different fonts and size can all have an impact on how easy the site is to navigate. I used a service called Siteimprove.com to help me work out what was working and what wasnt for accessability.
